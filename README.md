# Projet-pacman 

This project consists in developing a simplified version of the classic Pac-Man game using the C programming language. The main goal is to recreate the essential mechanics of the original game: character movement, ghost behavior, point collection, and collision detection.

The program uses either a text-based interface or a graphical library (such as SDL) to display the maze, characters, and interactive elements. The maze is typically represented using a matrix, making it easy to manage walls, pathways, and bonuses.

The code is structured into several modules, including:

Map management: loading the level and displaying the maze

Player movement (Pac-Man): processing keyboard input and checking collisions

Basic ghost AI: random or semi-directed movement

Score system: tracking collected points

Game loop: continuous screen updates and event handling
